# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
the hardest part was probably tracking the progress of the game and working around how the moves effect the next and how to tell when there is a win or when the game ends 

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
the computer needs to understand logic and strategy, so id have to find a way to code that in so that it has a "best guess" move for each configuraitons of the board so that it can decide whether or not to cross or add to the row, etc. after the logic, the last step would probably just be to integrate the computer player into the game loop so it knows when its turn is and plays in between your turns 


3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
there might be an algorithm that we can use to find the best posible option for the computer or maybe a database that contains all possible configurations of the board and the subsequesnt best chances of winning per possibe move for the computer
